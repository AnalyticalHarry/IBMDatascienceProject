## Introduction

This project explores the analysis of Tesla's historical stock and revenue data to gain insights into the company's financial performance over time. By leveraging various Python libraries, the project aims to extract, visualize, and interpret key financial metrics to provide a comprehensive view of Tesla's economic health.

## Overview

The project is divided into two main components:

1. **Stock Data Analysis**:
   - Using the `yfinance` library, we retrieve and analyze Tesla's historical stock prices. This involves fetching extensive historical data and visualizing the stock's closing price trends to understand its performance over time.

2. **Revenue Data Extraction**:
   - Revenue data is extracted through web scraping from MarketWatch using `BeautifulSoup`. This component focuses on gathering quarterly financial metrics such as total revenue, net income, and profit margins, providing a detailed view of Tesla's financial health and operational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Historical Stock Data Visualization**: Display of Tesla's closing stock prices over an extended period, offering insights into price trends and volatility.
- **Quarterly Revenue Metrics**: Extraction and presentation of key revenue-related metrics from publicly available financial statements, facilitating analysis of Tesla's performance and growth.

## Tools and Libraries

- **`yfinance`**: For fetching historical stock data.
- **`BeautifulSoup`**: For scraping and parsing revenue data from web pages.
- **`matplotlib`**: For creating visualizations of stock price trends.

## Objectives

- Provide a clear visualization of Teslaâ€™s historical stock performance.
- Extract and present detailed revenue data to assess the company's financial metrics.
- Build a foundation for further financial analysis and dashboard development.

## Future Directions

- Develop an interactive dashboard to combine stock and revenue data for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Extend the analysis to include additional financial metrics and other companies for comparative insights.
